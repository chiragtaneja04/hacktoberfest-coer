Rock paper scissors is a hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V).

This is a simulation of the original rock paper scissor game in which the computer will be making random choices among the three and the player can thus play with the computer.
