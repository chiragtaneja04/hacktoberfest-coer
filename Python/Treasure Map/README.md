# Treasure Map 

- It allow you to store your treasure in your desired Location. It just a basic game that allow you to input a numerical value based on a 3*3 matrix and store a character in that given location. 
- The main idea was that, the pirate broke into our house and hide its treasure somewhere that we dont know and left map that help us to find the treasure, so we have to find the treasure that pirates have hide in our house with the help of the map and store it somewhere else so that it will be hidden from all of the world, and cannot be foundable.
