# Video To Audio
- Converting videos to audio files might seem like an odd decision, but it can come in handy in specific cases. It is most often used to record the soundtrack of videos or to extract other audio tracks from videos where you are only interested in the sound.
- We are going to take a look at Moviepy module of python which is widely used for editing videos using python.
- Moviepy makes video editing painless in python and by using just few python one-liners one can get desired outcome!
- Here we are going to extract audio file from a sample video file.
- I have used a sample MP4 video clip. You can use any video file.
